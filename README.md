## Exercise #1 - CamelCase
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/camelcase/problem

Alice wrote a sequence of words in CamelCase as a string of letters, _s_ , with the following properties:
- All letters in the first word are lowercase
- For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is uppercase and rest of the letters are lowercase

Given _s_, print the number of words in _s_ on a new line.

Example: _s=oneTwoThree_ returns _3_

## Exercise #2 - Ceaser Cipher
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/caesar-cipher-1/problem

Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.

_caesarCipher_ has the following parameter(s):
- _s_: a string in cleartext
- _k_: an integer, the alphabet rotation factor
